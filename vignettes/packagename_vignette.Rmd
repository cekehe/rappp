  collapse = TRUE,

```

```{r setup}
library(rappp)
```

This package includes functions to enable a standardized workflow for quality control and 
some basic analysis and visualizations of autoimmunity data.
It also includes some functions related to peptide design, see the end.

This vignette will demonstrate a basic workflow using the included functions.

# Input data structure

Most functions are based on the below input structure, which is then built upon by the different functions.

```{r}
        SBA <- list(MFI=mfi,
                    COUNT=count,
                    SAMPLES=sampleinfo,
                    BEADS=beads,
                    CT=mfi_ct,
                    FILTERINFO=NULL)
```

The list elements are described in more detail below.

```{r}
head(mfi)
```

```{r}
head(count)
```

```{r}
head(sampleinfo)
```

```{r}
head(beads)
```

```{r}
head(mfi_ct)
```
