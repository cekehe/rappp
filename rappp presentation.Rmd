# Project workflow

- New Package template was created locally on Cecilia's computer.
- New repo was created on Cecilia's GitHub.
- The local and GitHub repos were connected.
--

- Forking and cloning by August and Sofia.
- August and Sofia made collaborators, to allow them to accept pull requests themselves.
--

- Incorprate separate funcitons for different parts of our data analysis workflow.
  - Sofia: Bead count visualization
  - Cecilia: Data transformation
  - August: Data visualization

# Bead count plot

```{r, eval = F}

bead_count_base(df_bead_count)



```

--
```{r, eval = F}
bead_count_ggplot(df_bead_count)

```
--
```{r, eval = F}
#> system.time(bead_count_base(df_bead_count))
#   user  system elapsed 
# 16.030   0.140  16.255

# Data transformation

Basic data transformation workflow:

Currently done differently by different people and often with copy-paste.

# Data visualization

```{r, eval = F}
beeswarm_ggplot(

  filename = "filename",
  sample_info = sampleinfo,
  bead_info = beadinfo,
  grouping_var = "diagnosis",
  sample_name_var = "sample_name",
  xlab = c("BIP/MAN", "DEL", "DEP", "SCA", "SCZ", "NON-PSY")
)

# Conclusions and future work

- Established our first package!

- Collaborated using github

- Started to use tidyverse functions<br/>

<br/>
<br/>


  

This will enable us to:
- More standardized workflow within group

- Continue building with our new knowledge!
