# Project workflow

- New Package template was created locally on Cecilia's computer.
- New repo was created on Cecilia's GitHub.
- The local and GitHub repos were connected.
--

- Forking and cloning by August and Sofia.
- August and Sofia made collaborators, to allow them to accept pull requests themselves.
--

- Incorprate separate funcitons for different parts of our data analysis workflow.
  - Sofia: Bead count visualization
  - Cecilia: Data transformation
  - August: Data visualization

# Bead count plot

```{r, eval = F}

bead_count_base(df_bead_count)



```

--
```{r, eval = F}
bead_count_ggplot(df_bead_count)

```
--
```{r, eval = F}
#> system.time(bead_count_base(df_bead_count))
#   user  system elapsed 
# 16.030   0.140  16.255
